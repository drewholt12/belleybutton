# BellyButton Biodiversity

## Purpose
In a quest to identify bacteria that synthesize scpecific proteins with beef flavors for imitation meat, a study was conducted on a group of volunteers.  These volunteers require the ability to view the results of testing with which they participated.  An interactive dashboard needs to be created where volunteers can view the top 10 bacterial species located in their bellybutton, and know if when a bacterial species is found that synthesized a beef flavored protien was found.  The website will show metadata for the volunteer including race, age, location, bellybutton type, and weekly wash frequency.  Three charts will be displayed showing the top 10 bacteria levels, a bubble chart with all bacteria found in visible levels, and a gauge chart depicting the volunteers wash frequency.  Visitors to the site will be able to select the volunteers ID number to display the results of the test.
